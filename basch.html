            <p>Basch fon Ronsenburg is a playable character in Final Fantasy XII and Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings. Basch is a 36-year-old man with a strong, muscular-though-emaciated build, a tall frame, and blue eyes. He has long blond slicked back hair, beard and goatee. Basch has a long scar across his left brow.</p>

            <p> Born in 670 Old Valendian in the Republic of Landis, Basch grew up with his identical twin brother, Noah fon Ronsenburg. Nineteen years prior to the events of Final Fantasy XII, the Archadian Empire attacked Landis and Basch left Landis to train in Dalmasca in hopes of restoring his old homeland. Landis fell and Basch assumed his family dead or enslaved to the Empire. When King Raminas agreed to a peace treaty with the Empire, word arrived that the treaty signing was a conspiracy to murder him. Basch led a force to Nalbina Fortress along with a young man named Reks. Basch rushed to Raminas while his forces stayed behind to fight the Archadians. Basch was attacked in King Raminas's chambers, and when he recognized his brother, Noah refused to acknowledge him, claiming he is now Gabranth, a judge of the Empire. Gabranth defeated Basch, and killed the king while impersonating his twin brother. When Reks arrived, he saw the murdered king and was attacked by Gabranth. Basch was blamed for Raminas's death and became known as the king-slayer. The peace negotiations fell apart and Archadian forces occupied Dalmasca. Though Archadia announced him executed, Basch was being held prisoner in the Nalbina Dungeons</p>
                
            <p>Basch has a fierce sense of loyalty and a professional manner. He abides by a knight's code, dedicating himself to restoring the country he serves. He is selfless, prioritizing others at the cost of his own reputation. </p>
