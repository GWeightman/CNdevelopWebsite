            <p>Ashelia B'nargin Dalmasca, otherwise known as Ashe and by the alias Amalia, is a playable character in Final Fantasy XII and Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings. She is the former Princess of Dalmasca and the only daughter of King Raminas. She is the last true descendant of King Raithwall, the Dynast King. She is 19 years old with a small build and slender frame. She has sandy blonde hair cropped above her shoulders, and concept art depicts her with either blue, brown, or gray eyes.</p>

            <p> In the year 704 Old Valendia, King Raminas and the king of the neighboring Kingdom of Nabradia arranged a political marriage between their children. Both Ashe and Lord Rasler understood that the marriage was to cement an alliance between Dalmasca and Nabradia against the conquering Archadian Empire. Despite the arranged marriage and the political nature of it, the two genuinely cared for one another. Ashe was widowed when Rasler was killed at the Battle of Nalbina Fortress, devastating the princess and fueling her hatred toward the Archadian Empire. Not long after Archadia made a full-scale assault on Dalmasca, Raminas intended to surrender to save his people. Yet, after signing a peace agreement with Archadia, he was killed by Judge Gabranth posing as his twin, Captain Basch.</p>
                
            <p>Ashe is a fiercely independent and driven young woman who will stop at nothing to restore her family to its rightful place. She is proud, aggrieved, determined, and loyal. Her fa√ßade can be broken by memories of Lord Rasler, reminding her of the joyful and carefree times of her youth. While Vaan is the game's designated protagonist, the bulk of the party's actions in Final Fantasy XII hinge on Ashe, and the main story is her drive to accumulate the power she needs to avenge her kingdom.</p>
