            <p>Vaan is the main protagonist of Final Fantasy XII and Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings. He was born in the year 689 Old Valendia, and grew up in Dalmasca's capital, the Royal City of Rabanastre. He is a 17-year-old youth standing at around 5'7". He has tanned skin, blond hair, and blue eyes. He wears a loose cropped open metal vest fastened with a pendant. His dark pants are held up by a red ribboned sash belt, and are tucked into a pair of knee-high steel boots.</p>

            <p> In 701, when Vaan was only twelve, his parents fell victim to the plague. Vaan and his elder brother Reks were taken in by his childhood friend Penelo and her family. Two years later, the war between Rozarria and Archadia bared upon its middle ground, Dalmasca, and a small scale raid of Rabanastre claimed the lives of Penelo's parents. During the Imperial occupation, Reks signed up as a light infantry soldier. When King Raminas agreed to a peace treaty and left for Nalbina Fortress to sign it, word arrived that the treaty signing was but a conspiracy to murder him. Reks was sent to the fortress, his squadron being led by Captain Basch fon Ronsenburg of the Order of the Knights. Reks was fatally wounded by what appeared to be Basch, who had murdered the king. Vaan is part of a lost generation, trying to find purpose in a life reduced to poverty. Vaan adopts a leadership role, being the eldest among the group of orphans he spends his time in. Vaan begrudges the Archadian Empire for the death of his brother, Reks, and the subjugation of his homeland. </p>
                
            <p>Vaan dreams of owning an airship and being a sky pirate free to travel Ivalice. Vaan does not play a large role in the Final Fantasy XII story, instead being a view-point and foil, observing and contrasting the actions of others who influence the unfolding events more directly.</p>
