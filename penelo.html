            <p>Penelo is a playable character in Final Fantasy XII and Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings. She is Vaan's childhood friend and dreams of being a dancer. Penelo is an athletic young girl, with honey eyes and blonde hair tied in pigtails with a short fringe and two long side bangs. She wears a gold-and-cornflower blue slim outfit with short white lacy sleeves and bronze wing-like armlets. She wears bronze bangles and gold-and-cornflower blue knee-high boots.</p>

            <p>Penelo grew up in the Royal City of Rabanastre with her family. Five years ago, a plague hit, but Penelo's family survived. Vaan's parents were not as lucky, and Penelo's family cared for both the orphaned Vaan and his elder brother, Reks. Three years later, the Archadian Empire invaded the Kingdom of Dalmasca, and Penelo's parents and Reks were killed in the conflict. Penelo was taken in by her parents' friend, the bangaa Migelo, who let her and Vaan work at his sundry shop, doing various odd-jobs.

            <p>As Vaan's close friend, Penelo acts as the "careful side" of his reckless persona and often tries to appeal to his common sense, but without a desirable effect. She is one of the many orphans in Rabanastre and was taken under the wing of Migelo, a local shopkeeper, and has helped him out since then. Due to the war taking the lives of her parents, she lives in fear of the Archadian Empire, but eventually overcomes her fear thanks to her unlikely friendship with Larsa Solidor, a member of the Empire's ruling family. Penelo, together with Vaan, acts as a humanizing element representing the common folk caught in the crossfire of international conflict. Looking to Vaan and Penelo keeps Princess Ashe grounded and able to resist the temptations of the Occuria, and looking to Penelo helps make Larsa sympathetic to the Dalmascan plight.</p>
